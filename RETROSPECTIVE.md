# Project Retrospective

## What Went Well

- **Clear Architecture:** The separation between frontend, backend, and database made development and debugging easier.
- **Type Safety:** Using TypeScript across the stack reduced runtime errors and improved code maintainability.
- **Effective Collaboration:** Version control and clear code reviews helped the team stay aligned.
- **Testing:** Automated tests (unit/integration) caught bugs early and increased confidence in deployments.
- **Documentation:** Keeping architecture and setup docs up-to-date helped onboard new contributors quickly.

---

## What Could Be Improved

- **Initial Setup:** Some dependencies and environment variables were tricky to configure at first.
- **Test Coverage:** Some edge cases and real-time features could use more thorough testing.
- **Error Handling:** More consistent error messages and logging would help with debugging in production.
- **Frontend/Backend Integration:** Occasional mismatches in API contracts required extra coordination.

## Challenges Faced

- **WebSocket Integration:** Ensuring real-time updates were reliable and performant took several iterations.
- **Prisma Migrations:** Managing schema changes and keeping the database in sync across environments was sometimes complex.
- **Dependency Mismatches:** Issues with mismatched package versions (e.g., React, testing libraries) caused some delays.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Automate Early:** Setting up CI/CD and automated tests early saves time and reduces manual errors.
- **Communication:** Regular check-ins and clear documentation prevent misunderstandings, especially around API contracts.
- **Iterative Development:** Building and testing features incrementally helped catch issues before they became blockers.

## Action Items & Next Steps

- Improve test coverage for real-time and edge-case scenarios.
- Enhance error handling and logging across the stack.
- Continue refining documentation, especially for onboarding and deployment.
- Explore performance optimizations for WebSocket and database interactions.
